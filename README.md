This plugin displays real-time server statistics on the player's action bar, including TPS, RAM usage, CPU usage, MSPT,
and Ping. It helps players monitor the performance of the server to see what's going on.

- A permission plugin is highly recommended, for example [LuckPerms](https://luckperms.net/), as it can manage all
  permissions.
- ActionInfo runs on Bukkit, Spigot, Paper and [Purpur (recommended)](https://purpurmc.org/).
- ActionInfo supports 1.13-1.19.x.
